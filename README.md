## What is this?

**Problem:** The world is becoming increasingly mobile, but the demand for high-fidelity 3D content is only growing. We needed a scalable approach to make this sort of content available on low-powered, low-bandwidth devices.

The 3DStreamingToolkit projectâ€™s purpose is to provide an approach for developing 3D server applications that stream frames in real-time to other devices over the network. Specifically:

* A server-side C++ plugin and samples for remotely rendering and streaming 3D scenes
* Cross-platform client-side samples for receiving streamed 3D scenes, including HoloLens
* Cloud infrastructure architecture to allow large-scale deployment
* Zero latency video compression using NvPipe/NVEncode
* WebRTC extensions for 3D content and input
