**APM Quality Assessment tool**

Python wrapper of audioproc_f with which quality assessment can be automatized.
The tool allows to simulate different noise conditions, input signals, APM
configurations and it computes different scores.
Once the scores are computed, the results can be easily exported to an HTML page
which allows to listen to the APM input and output signals and also the
reference one used for evaluation.

IMPORTANT: **the whole code has not been landed yet.**
