Video Quality Measurement Tool - VQMT 1.1 - March 30, 2013Author: Philippe Hanhart (philippe.hanhart@epfl.ch)Copyright(c) Multimedia Signal Processing Group (MMSPG),             Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL)             http://mmspg.epfl.chAll rights reserved.--------------------------- INTRODUCTION---------------------------This software provides fast implementations of the following objective metrics:- PSNR: Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio,- SSIM: Structural Similarity,- MS-SSIM: Multi-Scale Structural Similarity,- VIFp: Visual Information Fidelity, pixel domain version,- PSNR-HVS: Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio taking into account Contrast Sensitivity Function (CSF),- PSNR-HVS-M: Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio taking into account Contrast Sensitivity Function (CSF) and between-coefficient contrast masking of DCT basis functions.In this software, the above metrics are implemented in OpenCV (C++) based on the original Matlab implementations provided by their developers.The source code of this software can be compiled on any platform and only requires the OpenCV library (core and imgproc modules).This software allows performing video quality assessment without using Matlab and shows better performance than Matlab in terms of run time.--------------------------- PREREQUISITE---------------------------The OpenCV library (http://opencv.willowgarage.com/wiki/) needs to be installed to be able to compile this code. Only the core and imgproc modules are required.This software was developed using OpenCV 2.4.0, but earlier/newer versions of OpenCV are most likely compatible since only low-level features, such as filtering and resizing, are used.The OpenCV dlls are provided directly with the Windows binaries, such that the software can work directly without installing the OpenCV library.--------------------------- USAGE---------------------------VQMT.exe OriginalVideo ProcessedVideo Height Width NumberOfFrames ChromaFormat Output Metrics OriginalVideo: the original video as raw YUV video file, progressively scanned, and 8 bits per sampleProcessedVideo: the processed video as raw YUV video file, progressively scanned, and 8 bits per sampleHeight: the height of the videoWidth: the width of the videoNumberOfFrames: the number of frames to processChromaFormat: the chroma subsampling format. 0: YUV400, 1: YUV420, 2: YUV422, 3: YUV444Output: the name of the output file(s)Metrics: the list of metrics to use available metrics: - PSNR: Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PNSR) - SSIM: Structural Similarity (SSIM) - MSSSIM: Multi-Scale Structural Similarity (MS-SSIM) - VIFP: Visual Information Fidelity, pixel domain version (VIFp) - PSNRHVS: Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio taking into account Contrast Sensitivity Function (CSF) (PSNR-HVS) - PSNRHVSM: Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio taking into account Contrast Sensitivity Function (CSF) and between-coefficient contrast masking of DCT basis functions (PSNR-HVS-M)Example:VQMT.exe original.yuv processed.yuv 1088 1920 250 1 results PSNR SSIM MSSSIM VIFPwill create the following output files in CSV (comma-separated values) format:- results_pnsr.csv- results_ssim.csv- results_msssim.csv- results_vifp.csvNotes:- SSIM comes for free when MSSSIM is computed (but you still need to specify it to get the output)- PSNRHVS and PSNRHVSM are always computed at the same time (but you still need to specify both to get the two outputs)- When using MSSSIM, the height and width of the video have to be multiple of 16- When using VIFP, the height and width of the video have to be multiple of 8Changes in version 1.1 (since 1.0) on 30/3/13- Added support for large files (>2GB)- Added support for different chroma sampling formats (YUV400, YUV420, YUV422, and YUV444)--------------------------- COPYRIGHT---------------------------Permission is hereby granted, without written agreement and without license or royalty fees, to use, copy, modify, and distribute the software provided and its documentation for research purpose only, provided that this copyright notice and the original authors' names appear on all copies and supporting documentation.The software provided may not be commercially distributed.
